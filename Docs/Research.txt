data to find:
- NAV: net asset value
    - The price of a mutual fund share is referred to as the net asset value (NAV) per share, sometimes expressed as NAVPS.
    - A fund's NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the total amount of shares outstanding.
    - Outstanding shares are those held by all shareholders, institutional investors, and company officers or insiders.

- Name:
    - Titels show type of funds

- Strategy:
    - STOCKS: (EQUITY)
        - An equity fund is a mutual fund that invests principally in stocks. It can be actively
          or passively (index fund) managed. Equity funds are also known as stock funds.
    
    - BONDS
        - Federal Goverments
        - Corporations
        - investors are paid a fixed amount back on their initial investment
        - Bond Index
            - a diversified portfolio of bonds that are chosen to align with the performance of a specific bond index.
              An index seeks to track the value or performance of the securities in that index. So a bond index fund invests
              in those securities with the aim of closely matching that performance
    
    - BALANCED:
        - A balanced fund is a mutual fund that typically contains a component of stocks and bonds.
          A mutual fund is a basket of securities in which investors can purchase. Typically, balanced funds
          stick to a fixed asset allocation of stocks and bonds, such as 70% stocks and 30% bonds. Bonds are
          debt instruments that usually pay a stable, fixed rate of return.
          The investment objective for a balanced mutual fund tends to be a mixture of growth and income,
          which leads to the balanced nature of the fund. Balanced mutual funds are geared toward investors
          who are looking for a mixture of safety, income, and modest capital appreciation.
        - Also known as asset allocation funds. Combination of equity and fixed-income funds with a fixed ratio of investments such as 60% stocks and 40% bonds.
          Meant to to reduce the risk of exposure across asset classes
        - Balanced funds (also called asset allocation funds or hybrid funds) are often a “fund of funds,” investing in a group of other mutual funds
    
    - VALUE
        - A value fund seeks to invest in stocks that are deemed to be undervalued in price based
          on fundamental characteristics. Value investing is often contrasted with growth investing,
          which focuses on emerging companies with high growth prospects.
          aka divident mutual funds
        - Picking Stable Value Fund:
            - credit quality or rate
                - lower quality is greater risk
                - high quality survives better through economies
            - tipical drivers are:
                - duration
                - credit quality
            - longer duration or lower quality = higher yield
            - choose some risk, but not too high

    - GROWTH
        - A growth fund is a diversified portfolio of stocks that has capital appreciation as its
          primary goal, with little or no dividend payouts. The portfolio mainly consists of companies
          with above-average growth that reinvest their earnings into expansion, acquisitions, or research
          and development (R&D). Most growth funds offer higher potential capital appreciation but usually
          at above-average risk.
        - Higher growth, more potential volatility
        - Younger people tend to go for these
    
    - BLEND
        - A blend fund (or blended fund) is a type of equity mutual fund that includes a mix of both value
          and growth stocks. These funds offer investors diversification among these popular investment
          styles in a single portfolio. Blend funds are a particular case of a hybrid fund.
    
    - CAPITALIZATION:
        - Size of companies.
          shares outstanding * share price = capitalization
    
    - SECTOR / COMODITIES:
        - Specialty (Based on industry or sector) funds

    - INCOME
        - An income fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that emphasizes
          current income, either on a monthly or quarterly basis, as opposed to capital gains
          or appreciation. Such funds usually hold a variety of government, municipal, and
          corporate debt obligations, preferred stock, money market instruments, and dividend-paying stocks.
          They may invest in bonds or other fixed-income securities as well as preferred shares and
          dividend stocks.
        - Holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams
    
    - INDEX (PASSIVE)
        - An index fund is a type of mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) with a portfolio
          constructed to match or track the components of a financial market index, such as the
          Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (S&P 500). An index mutual fund is said to provide broad
          market exposure, low operating expenses, and low portfolio turnover. These funds follow
          their benchmark index regardless of the state of the markets. 
        - passive investment by following index. No managing = much lower fees
        - all index funds are mutual funds
        - You can only by or sell once a day
        - they offer automatic reinvestment per month that is free
    
    - ETF
        - Exchange Traded Funds
        - Very similar to Index, but trade multiple times a day possible
        - You can buy and sell them as if they were a stock through the day
        - have to pay trading comissions
        - not considered mutual funds but employ strategies consistent with mutual funds
        - structured as investment trusts that are traded on stock exchanges and have the added benefits of the features of stocks
        - also enjoy tax advantages from mutual funds

    - CEF
        - Closed-end funds
        - Investment vehicles with shares listed on multiple global stock exchanges, like the New York Stock Exchange
          and the London Stock Exchange, that essentially trade like stocks. Closed-end funds still command significant attention in the
          investment world, even though they are in moderate decline lately.
    
    - MONEY MARKET:
        - Short-term debt fund
        - Invest in high-quality, short-term debt from governments, banks or corporations. Like U.S. Treasurys, certificates of deposit and commercial paper.
    
    - FUTURE
        - The Future Fund is a financial asset fund, set up to strengthen the Commonwealth's long-term financial position by making provision for unfunded
          superannuation liabilities that will become payable during a period when an ageing population is likely to place significant pressure on the
          Commonwealth's finances.
    
    - DOMESTIC
        - US based

    - GLOBAL
        - A global fund is a fund that invests in companies located anywhere in the world including the
          investor’s own country. A global fund seeks to identify the best investments from a global
          universe of securities. Global funds may also be passively managed.
    
    - INTERNATIONAL
        - An international fund is a mutual fund that can invest in companies located anywhere in the world
          outside of its investors' country of residence. International funds differ from global funds,
          which can invest in companies from any country in the world. International funds may also be
          referred to as foreign funds.
    
    - EMERGING
        - Countries with small but growing markets
    
    - TARGET DATE

    - LONG-SHORT EQUITY
        - Long-short equity is an investment strategy that seeks to take a long position in underpriced stocks while selling short overpriced shares
        - Long-short seeks to augment traditional long-only investing by taking advantage of profit opportunities from securities identified as both
          under-valued and over-valued.
        - Long-short equity is commonly used by hedge funds, which often take a relative long bias—for instance, a 130/30 strategy where
          long exposure is 130% of AUM and 30% is short exposure.
        - Long Position in stocks that are expected to appreciate and are underpriced
        - Short position in stocks that are expected to decline and are overpriced
        - Having a Long Position in a security means that you own the security. Investors maintain Long security positions in the expectation that the
          stock will rise in value in the future. It describes what an investor has purchased when they buy a security or derivative with the
          expectation that it will rise in value. A bullish attitude. A long position in options contracts indicates the holder owns the underlying
          asset. Being long on a stock or bond investment is a measurement of time.
        - Having a Short Position in a security is generally the sale of a stock you do not own.

- Allocation:
    - Asset allocation sums up to 100%,  which means that the invested volume and cash all together build total net assets.
    - Shorting on the asset may cause negative allocation

- Minimum Investment Amount
    - Larger amounts have normaly lower Fees

- Fees
    - Expense Ratio:
        - Running cost to maintain fund
        - percent of value of your account taken out in certain timely period
        - 1% considered high, 0.5% is common
        - Total Expense Ratio:
            - Measures the total costs related to managing an investment fund
            - It is also the total cost of an investment to an investor. TER is important to investors because it determines
              whether an investment is profitable or otherwise given its associated costs.
        - Net Expense Ratio:
            - Net expense ratio and 'after reimbursement expense ratio' are other terms that have the same meaning as the total expense ratio (TER).
            - This ratio reflects the percentage of mutual fund or ETF assets steered toward a fund's operating expenses and
              fund management fees. It's basically a list of fund expenses, minus brokerage costs and sales charges, and is
              calculated into the fund's net asset value (NAV.)
        - Gross Expense Ratio:
            - Measures the total percentage of the mutual funds assets used in operating or managing the fund
        - Adjusted Expense Ratio:
            - Excludes certain variable investment-related expenses, such as interest from borrowings and dividends on borrowed securities,
              sallowing for more consistent cost comparisons across funds
    - Front-endLoad:
        - If buying or selling directly you could be charged for a load = comission (in percent)
        - Most funds don't anymore
        - Stay away from funds with Load

    - Purchase and sale fees:
        - Broker may charge a fee per transaction (buy or sell)

- Distribution:
    - Yield (make sure what unit it's in, mostly percent) (aka distribution yield)
        - Percentage of holdings value payed
            - Yield = Annual Divident and or interest payment per share / NAV
            - Calculated daily with the fund's net asset value (NAV), which is determined after the market closes each day.
            - Check prospectus on how exactly it is calculated
        - Dividends
            - Dividend Yield = Divident payed / Stock price
            - The trailing twelve month dividend yield is the sum of the dividends paid over the past twelve months
              divided by the value of one mutual fund share
            - Equity Funds pay dividends payed by the stocks in portfolio. If any of these stocks pay dividends, then
              the mutual fund also pays dividends.
        - Interest
            - Most bonds pay guaranteed amounts of interest each year, called coupon payments. Because bonds pay interest,
              bond funds do as well.
            - Money market funds pay interest, though the rate of return is generally lower than other fund types
        - SEC yield is an annualized figure based on returns over the most recent 30-day period
        - Total return takes into consideration all dividend distributions paid to the fund
        - Capital Gain
            - Any increase in a capital asset's value.
            - Payments from a mutual fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF) to its holders that are a portion
              of proceeds from the fund's sales of stocks or other portfolio assets.
            - tend not to be accurate
        - Return to shareholders to reinvest
        - Higher yield mostly have riskier investments
        - Upp Yield Curve = bullish
        - Down Yield Curve = bearish
        - high yield could be high expense ratio
        - Yield Curve in Bonds:
            - Bond Yield = Interest or Annual Coupon Payment / Bond price
              example ... $60/year and market value of $1000 , 6% Yield
            - curve is y-axis = yield and x-axis = maturity time
        - Picking good High Yield Bond Fund:
            - High Yield = Big returns with significant risks
            - largely corporate Bonds
            - lower quality , economic sensitive
            - get hit harder when economy goes down

Risk:
    - Low Risk:
        - Debt Funds
    - Moderate Risk:
        - Hybrid Funds
    - High Risk:
        - Equity Funds
    - Measures:
        - Beta:
            Calculates relative volatility of a stock/mutual fund as against the benchmark.
            Default Beta = 1.0
            1.0 = Fund moves in line with the benchmark
            Lower value is lower relative risk. But it's relative, not an actual risk factor.
            Good for diversification analysis.
            Based on historical data, so it's not a guaranty of future results

        - Alpha:
            Gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or bench mark in percentage.
            Alpha = 0% = performed exactly the same as bench mark
            Used in conjunction with Beta
            Based on historical data, so it's not a guaranty of future results

        - R-Squared:
            Measures a fund's correlation to it's benchmark performance.
            R2 = 100 = fund perfectly correlated with performance of benchmark
            Index Funds have a range of 98 - 100
            R2 < 80 = fund does not perform like typical index
            if R2 = 90-100 , maybe change to Index fund that have lower Expense Ratio
            Value fund categort have usually R2 < 90

        - Standard Deviation:
            Represents the volatility or riskiness of the fund.
            Lets say of the average return = 10% but it fluctuated between +20% and -15%,
            the fluctuation is what Standard Deviation captures.
            If Average Return = 10% and Standard Deviation = 3%,
            68% of the time it can be 10% - 3% or 10% + 4%
            The higher the deviation , the higher the volatility is.
            Sectoral Thematic and Small Cap Funds have higher Deviation = higher Volatility
            Hybrid Funds have smaller Deviation

        - Sharpe Ratio:
            Measures the performance of an investment compared to risk-free asset, after
            adjusting for its risk.
            (RP-RF)/SD
            RP = return on portfolio
            RF = Risk free rate of return
            SD = Standard Deviation
            The higher , the better risk adjusted return. It has better potential in earning
            more return per unit of risk.

        - Sortino Ratio

Fund structure and management:
    - Fund Company that creates and manages it
    - Broker custodian through where you own the Fund
    - Operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income
      for the fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated
      in its prospectus. Most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard,
      T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer. A mutual fund has a fund manager, sometimes called its investment adviser, who is legally
      obligated to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders.
