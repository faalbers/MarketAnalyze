Long-term capital appreciation:
    - Growth in the value of your investment over time
    - Aim to substantially grow your principal, which is the original amount you invested in the fund.
      They do so by investing in the stock of companies that tend to yield above-average gains. These
      funds are ideal for investors who seek long-term capital appreciation.

Secure current income:
    - Income funds, in contrast, invest in dividend-paying stocks and bonds in order to provide investors
      with income. These funds are appropriate for individuals who desire monthly income in retirement.

Balance between both:
    - When it comes to establishing retirement investment goals, growth or income is not an either-or.
      You can add both growth and income mutual funds to your retirement portfolio to achieve a balance
      between capital appreciation and income. In fact, a portfolio that features both growth-oriented
      funds invested in stock and income-oriented funds invested in dividend-producing stocks and bonds
      is more diversified because it contains multiple investment classes with varying levels of risk.

Risk Tolerance:
    - Your comfort level with potential ups and downs in returns on your investment is referred to as
      your risk tolerance
    - Growth funds are subject to more fluctuations because they carry the potential for higher returns
    - Growth funds come with varying levels of risk. For example, aggressive growth funds that invest
      in riskier securities require a higher risk tolerance than conservative growth funds that invest
      in low-risk securities
    - Income funds are less risky because they offer lower returns in exchange for income. They won't
      increase as sharply as a growth fund in a rising market, but they may not fall as substantially
      during a down market. Like income retirement mutual funds
    - Income funds come in various risk levels from conservative (low-risk) income funds that focus
      solely on producing income to aggressive (high-risk) income funds that offer income and capital
      appreciation

Time Horizon:
    - Time horizon is the number of years you have left until you retire, which will influence your
      investment goal, your risk tolerance, and, ultimately, your selection of mutual funds
    - Long time horizon
        - Years or even decades until retirement
        - Long-term capital appreciation
        - Your risk tolerance may also be higher
        - A growth fund can support these objectives
    - Shorter time horizon
        - A few years until retirement
        - Secure income
        - Risk tolerance will also be lower
        - An income fund, which can help soften losses during a downturn, can deliver on these
          objectives and keep your mind at ease
